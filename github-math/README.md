github-math
===========

GitHub does not support LaTeX-math in Markdown, but offers a
rendering service which can create images from LaTeX strings
passed as query parameters. This filter converts math elements
into images, which will be generated through GitHub's service.

The main use-case for this filter is to produce files for
rendering by GitHub, e.g. `README.md`. Combine with output format
`gfm` for best results.

Example
-------

Let's assume we have written a math-heavy library and want to put
it on GitHub. The documentation contains many math formulas, like
so:

    The Manhattan norm (or $L^1$ norm) is defined as
    $$\|v\|_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left|v_i\right|$$.


Using this filter to transforms the document into GitHub Flavored
Markdown (gfm), all math expressions are replaced by images, like
so:

    The Manhattan norm (or
    ![L^1](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L^1&mode=inline)
    norm) is defined as ![\\|v\\|\_1 = \\sum\_{i = 1}^n
    \\left|v\_i\\right|](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5C|v%5C|_1%20%3D%20%5Csum_{i%20%3D%201}^n%20%5Cleft|v_i%5Cright|&mode=display)
